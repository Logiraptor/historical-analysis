# Historical Analysis

This repo contains code to perform analysis on every commit in a git repo.

This is accomplished using docker as follows:

1. You create a docker image containing the git repo and any tools required to do the analysis.
2. The tool iterates through all commits in the repo, commiting a new docker image for each.
3. For each image, a user specified set of tools are run in a container created from that image.
4. The results are collected and written to a csv file
5. The csv is copied from the master container to the host machine for further analysis
